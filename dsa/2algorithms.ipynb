Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor. \n",

It's 14x faster! There is a total of 1,000,000,000 (1Billion) landing cells to be checked. Binary Search would take around 30ms, because $log_2(1000000000)\\approx 30$. Since binary search is 14x faster, linear search would take $14 * 30ms = 420ms$. That's well below 10s -> Bob chooses Linear Search.\n",

    "__efficiency__ of different __algorithms__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Big O notation* is often used in identifying how complex a problem is, also known as the problem's complexity class. The mathematician Paul Bachmann (1837-1920) was the first to use this notation, in the second edition of his book \"Analytische Zahlentheorie\", in 1896. Edmund Landau (1877-1938) made the notation popular. For this reason, when people talk about a Landau symbols, they refer to this notation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Big O notation is named after the term \"order of the function\", which refers to the growth of functions. Big O notation is used to find the upper bound (the highest possible amount) of the function's growth rate, meaning it works out the longest time it will take to turn the input into the output. This means an algorithm can be grouped by how long it can take in a worst-case scenario, where the longest route will be taken every time. "
