    "A __linked list__ is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order. Unlike an array, however, in which the linear order is determined by the array indices, the order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each object.\n",

    "Linked lists provide a simple, flexible representation for dynamic sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form, each node contains: __data__, and a __reference__ (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists. \n",
